******************************

Hello everyone!

My name is Oleg Larionov, I am 34 years old, and I'm from Kazan. I am applying for a junior Frontend developer position.
I am a graduate of the Faculty of Public Administration at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, with a degree in management.
However, currently, I am a student at RS School, undergoing a Frontend development course.
My goal is to acquire the skills necessary for development and eventually lead a frontend development team or be part of a team working on interesting and challenging projects. The digital world is evolving rapidly  and I aspire to be one of the creators of these changes. Perhaps one day, I'll create an application that makes people's lives a little better or simplifies their daily routines.

I am highly persistent and determined to achieve my goals. While not all the study material comes easy to me   initially, challenges never deter me; on the contrary, the greater the challenge, the more I can learn.

Difficulties motivate me.

A vivid example of this  is the entire Frontend development course at school. Previously, I only studied the Basic and C languages  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were entirely new territories for me  School projects compelled me to immerse myself completely and start from scratch in the frontend world. Thanks to my determination, I managed to master HTML for layout and then I did the same with JavaScript in the Nonograms project. It was fascinating, and I am sure that this is the direction I want to (пЕсью)pursue. Most importantly, it is interesting to continue developing, to (дИИпен)deepen my understanding of the logic behind methods and functions, and to apply and discover new technologies and frameworks to progress towards my goal.

Thanks for your attantion!
Sorry for my English :)
